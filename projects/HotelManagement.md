For my ICS 211 class we were programming in Java. For one of our biggest projects I decided to create a system that could be used at a hotel. This system was capable of booking rooms, checking if rooms are available, organizing rooms into doubles, singles, handicap, by floors, and even the preferred rooms with better views. The idea was to create a system that could work flawless for a person working behind the desk in a hotel lobby. 
Despite this projects simplicity, this was one of my most lengthy projects. Unfortunately the code for it is long lost but I definitely demonstrated good use of objects, functions, and other fundementals of java. (Again this was early on in my coding journey) Completeing this project made me realise how good it feels to create something with complexity that actual ends up working. I would say it feels very rewarding in the fact that you can say "I made that" and you make it from nothing too which makes it even more special. Just like baking cake from scratch vs using a box recipe.
