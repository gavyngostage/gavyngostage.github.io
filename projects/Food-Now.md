In the context of my ICS 211 course, which focused on Java programming, I embarked on a substantial project that entailed the development of a hotel management system. This project was designed to encompass a range of functionalities essential to a hotel's day-to-day operations, including room reservations, real-time room availability checks, categorization of rooms by type (such as doubles, singles, handicap-accessible, by floor, and preferred rooms with scenic views), all with the goal of streamlining tasks for hotel front desk personnel.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this project proved to be one of my most extensive undertakings at that stage of my coding journey. Regrettably, the code for this project has been lost to time, but it served as a testament to my aptitude in implementing fundamental Java concepts, such as object-oriented programming and the utilization of functions. Completing this project was a pivotal moment that underscored the immense satisfaction of creating a complex system that functions seamlessly. It epitomized the joy of crafting something from scratch, transforming a conceptual idea into a tangible, functional reality, akin to the difference between baking a cake from a basic recipe and creating one entirely from scratch, replete with personalized nuances and complexities.
