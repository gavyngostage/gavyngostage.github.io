## Food-Now: Fueling UH Manoa with Culinary Inspiration
Remember that feeling of wandering around campus, lost in a sea of options, unsure where to grab a satisfying bite? Food-Now, a web app built by a dedicated team, aims to solve this dilemma for students and faculty at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

# Unveiling the Culinary Landscape:

Imagine an interactive map, dotted with vibrant icons representing campus food vendors. Click on one, and a full menu unfolds, showcasing culinary delights from around the globe. Food-Now empowers you to explore your options, from the familiar comfort of a campus cafe to the hidden gems tucked away in food trucks.

# Beyond the Map:

Food-Now isn't just about mapping hunger. It's a comprehensive platform offering:

- **Vendor List**: Browse through a detailed directory of campus food options, categorized for easy exploration.
- **Menu Explorer**: Dive into each vendor's culinary offerings, complete with descriptions and mouthwatering pictures (where available).
- **Admin Panel**: For authorized users, managing the platform is a breeze. Add or remove vendors, users, and food items, ensuring Food-Now stays up-to-date and delicious.

# My Culinary Contribution:

As a member of the Food-Now team, I played a key role in shaping the user experience. Here's how I contributed:

- **Building the Gateway**: I crafted the sign-in and sign-up pages, welcoming users into a world of culinary exploration.
- **Campus Color Palette**: I transformed the website's general styling, infusing it with the vibrant school colors, creating a familiar and welcoming atmosphere.
- **Navigating the Buffet**: I built the user pages for listing all users, vendors, and their menu items, ensuring smooth navigation through the platform's offerings.
- **Maintaining the Home Plate**: I played a central role in keeping the organization's home page fresh and informative, ensuring it reflects the project's latest developments.

# From Bytes to Bites: Lessons Learned:

Food-Now wasn't just a project; it was a learning journey. Here's what I discovered:

- **Teamwork**: Working within a large team taught me the intricate dance of collaboration. We shared ideas, tackled challenges together, and learned from each other's strengths.
- **GitHub**: The Master Chef of Project Management: Previously a mystery, GitHub became my culinary companion. I learned to navigate its repositories, contribute code, and collaborate with teammates in real-time.
- **From Pixels to Plates**: Web Dev Decoded: I honed my web development skills, mastering the art of crafting beautiful and functional websites. I learned to utilize frameworks like Meteor and React, transforming code into user-friendly experiences.

# A Taste of What's Next:

Food-Now is a project in constant evolution, and I'm excited to see it grow. We envision adding features like food reviews, personalized recommendations, and even delivery options.
