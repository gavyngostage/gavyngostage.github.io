During my high school years, I enrolled in the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science course, which provided an opportunity to engage in a substantial collaborative project. In this endeavor, I collaborated with a group of four peers, and we were tasked with developing an application utilizing MIT App Inventor, a drag-and-drop code software platform. Our project of choice involved the creation of an FBI officer locating application, addressing a critical challenge faced by law enforcement agencies: the need for real-time tracking of fellow officers' whereabouts.

Our application integrated Google Maps' "friend tracking" services, providing law enforcement officers with a reliable means of pinpointing the locations of their colleagues. What set this project apart was its emphasis on presentation and marketability, rather than merely the code implementation. We were required to deliver a compelling 20-minute presentation, akin to a "Shark Tank" pitch, aimed at convincing law enforcement personnel of the app's merits and its potential to address their operational needs. This project provided a valuable lesson in integrating external services, such as Google Maps, into an application, a skill I would later leverage in the development of my own surf report application.
