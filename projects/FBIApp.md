In High School, I took AP Computer Science. For our final project in that class, myself and a group of four others were tasked with creating an application using a drag and drop code software called MIT App Inventor. We chose the project option that entailed creating a FBI officer locating app. The problem presented to us was this. Sometimes in law enforcement officers and agents have a hard time figuring out where their fellow officers are located. Our app implemented google maps "friend tracking" services to help allow officers to always be able to find where their coworkers are located. This was an interesting project because it focused less on the code itself and more on the presentation. We were to make a 20 minute presentation that talked about why they should use our app. Our mission was to really try and sell it to them as if it was shark tank. 
The most helpful thing I gained from this project was learning how to implent a service such as google maps into my own application. I would use this same method down the line to create my own surf report application.
