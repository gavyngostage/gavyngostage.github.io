#Intro
In the realm of software development, the term "coding standards" often conjures images of nitpicky details such as indentation preferences and brace placements. However, I believe that coding standards represent a cornerstone of software engineering.  In this essay, we will explore the profound impact of coding standards on software development and share insights on their significance.
##What are Coding Standards?
Coding standards are a set of rules and conventions that dictate how code should be written. These standards address various aspects such as formatting, naming conventions, documentation, and code organization. While some might dismiss them as trivial and a waste of time, I argue that coding standards can help universalise code and enhance the learning experience for newcomers as well.
##Learning from Coding Standards
One overlooked aspect of coding standards is their educational value. When developers follow a set of standards, they absorb the best practices and idioms of a programming language or framework. This process of immersion is similar to how it's easier to learn a language when you're physically immersed in that culture.
##Enhancing Code Quality
After my first week of ESLint with IntelliJ, I can attest to the positive effects it has had on my code in general. Getting that green check mark in the top right is satisfying and can be related slightly to a pat on the head after getting something done. On the flip side it can be frusturating as well. Sometimes, (especially in a time crunch such as a timed coding assingment) getting that green checkmark can be annoying. For example you wanted to declare an extra variable in your function for your own sake, but ESLint might not like that since it's not technically necessary. You'll get an error saying that the variable is redundant and should be done a simpler way. My only nitpick is that sometimes the "simpler way" is harder to read for a human.
##Conclusion
In conclusion, I do not believe that coding standards are trivial in the world of software engineering. They serve as a guide of a seasoned developer and a valuable learning tool for newcomers. Coding standards, using tools like ESLint, promote consistency, readability, and maintainability.
