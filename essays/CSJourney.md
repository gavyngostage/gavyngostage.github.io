# Exploring the Vast Horizons of Computer Science: A Senior's Odyssey

As a senior on the cusp of obtaining my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, I find myself reflecting on the winding journey that has brought me to this pivotal moment. My path in computer science has been marked by diverse experiences and a passion that was initially ignited by my love for video games, a dream of becoming a video game developer that has evolved into a rich tapestry of possibilities in the tech world.

My dive into the realm of computer science began in high school when I took on the challenge of AP Computer Science. I already had an absolute love for technology, but this class made it certain that it was what I was going to pursue in my higher education.

Throughout my academic journey, I have ventured into various programming languages, each providing a unique lens through which to view the intricate world of computer science. Java, C, C++, C#, SQL, and Javascript have all left their mark on my educational landscape, offering me a diverse skill set that has proven invaluable in my quest to explore the many facets of this discipline.

As I stated previously, my initial passion for computer science was firmly rooted in my love for video games. I aspired to be a video game developer, but as my academic journey unfolded, I realized that the vast landscape of computer science offered me a multitude of paths to explore. While video game development remains a cherished dream, it has now become one of many avenues I can pursue within this dynamic field.

My practical experiences have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of computer science. I have had the privilege of completing two internships with Northrop Grumman, a leading defense company with a strong presence in government contracting. During my first internship, I was tasked with creating a data visualization application, drawing upon my SQL expertise and database skills. This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also exposed me to the real-world applications of data management and analysis.

In my second internship with Northrop Grumman, I assumed the role of a Systems Test Engineer. This role required me to rigorously test different procedures on various systems with each new build release, all within the dynamic ecosystem of Red Hat Linux. Testing came with many issues, I would say I was troubleshooting 70% of the time and testing the other 30%. This role broadened my understanding of systems, quality assurance, and the critical role testing plays in the development process.

Beyond my academic and internship pursuits, I have dedicated my free time to coding projects that align with my interests. I have developed a mobile game and several desktop games, all leveraging the Unity game engine. These projects not only provided me with hands-on experience but also allowed me to explore the creative and artistic side of computer science.

As I stand on the precipice of graduation, I am confronted with a multitude of potential career paths within the tech industry. The prospect of software development, systems engineering, cybersecurity, and other specialized fields beckon, each offering its unique set of challenges and opportunities. While I may feel a touch of nervous anticipation, I am equally excited to embrace the next chapter of my career.

In retrospect, my journey through computer science has been a thrilling odyssey filled with discovery and growth. While I may not possess all the skills required for advanced full-time roles, I am armed with a solid foundation, a passion for learning, and the determination to continually evolve in this ever-evolving field. My time as a computer science student has been a captivating voyage, and I eagerly anticipate the adventures that await me in the tech industry's vast and ever-expanding horizon.
