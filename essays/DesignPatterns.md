## Understanding and Incorporating Design Patterns

In the realm of coding, I stumbled upon these things called design patterns. They’re like these cool blueprints that help me build things more efficiently. So, imagine this: when I was creating objects, I found these two pals – Factory Method and Singleton. The Factory Method helped me make objects without spelling out the specifics each time. And the Singleton? It made sure I had just one global access point to stuff. Super handy for keeping things organized and not making a mess with multiple instances.

Then came Structural Patterns - Adapter and Decorator. The Adapter pattern was like a translator, helping incompatible stuff talk to each other. And the Decorator? It was like adding layers of functionality to objects, making them cooler without messing with their core. These patterns made it easier for me to extend behavior and combine objects like Lego blocks.

When I got into Behavioral Patterns like Observer and Strategy, things got even more interesting. The Observer pattern was like a messenger spreading news across different parts of my code whenever something changed. And the Strategy? It gave me options to switch strategies easily, like choosing the best tool for the job. These patterns were like tools to manage how things behave and talk to each other in my code.

So, when someone asks about the design patterns I've used, I think about these buddies: Factory Methods for creating, Adapters for bridging gaps, Observers for keeping things in sync, and Strategies for picking the right move. These patterns have become part of how I write code, not just solutions, but like shortcuts that make my code smarter and neater.

These design patterns are like the secret weapons in my coding toolbox. They’re not just fancy terms but practical ways to make coding life easier. And they’re always there to guide me through the maze of programming challenges!
